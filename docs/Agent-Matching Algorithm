The criteria that determine agent selection for call reconnection in call centers typically include the following key factors:

Customer History and Context
The system uses CRM data to identify which agent previously handled the customer’s issue or call history to maintain continuity and reduce the need for customers to repeat information.​

Priority is often given to agents with the knowledge and skills specific to the customer’s issue or previous case handling.​

Agent Availability and Workload
The availability of the previously connected agent is an important factor. If that agent is available and not overloaded, the system may route the callback to them.​

If the prior agent is unavailable, the call may be routed to the next available agent or one with the least workload at that moment.​

Timing and Urgency
Callback requests scheduled for specific times may influence which agent is assigned, often matching agents scheduled to work during that time slot.​

For urgent or high-priority customers, reconnection to the same agent may be prioritized to boost resolution speed and satisfaction.​

Skill-Based Routing
Agents are selected based on matching the caller’s needs with the agent’s expertise, language skills, or certifications.​

Call centers apply Intelligent Call Routing (ICR) techniques that use algorithms weighing agent skills, customer profiles, and call context.​

Operational Policies and Technological Capabilities
Some call centers set policies on maximum callback attempts per agent or on whether callbacks are routed automatically to the same agent or distributed among a pool.​

Technology constraints like the sophistication of the ACD (Automatic Call Distributor) and CRM integration impact agent reconnection decisions.

Customer Preference
If the system allows, customers may request or express preference for a specific agent during callback scheduling.​
